# Warehouse_Management_System
This project is a C++ application that simulates a basic Warehouse Management System. It includes core components such as product, user, order, and reporting management.

# Features
- Modular Product Architecture: Designed with Product and BaseProduct classes to support scalability and future extension for new product types, ensuring clean and maintainable object-oriented design.
- Robust Order Management System: Handles the full lifecycle of customer orders, with clear separation of concerns and efficient data handling mechanisms.
- Built-in Input Validation Layer: Ensures user inputs are sanitized and validated in real-time, reducing the risk of runtime errors and improving overall system stability.
- User-Friendly Menu Interface: Terminal-based navigation system provides a structured and intuitive experience, suitable for non-technical users as well as developers.
- Automated Reporting Engine: Integrated ReportManager generates real-time operational summaries and insights, which can be easily extended to support analytics dashboards or exportable reports.
